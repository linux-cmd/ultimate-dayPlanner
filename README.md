# ultimate-dayPlanner
The ultimate day planner to plan tasks, events, and mark through your calendar.

This marks the start of my journey in Web development and fully understanding javascript.
My journey will most likely not go past the complexity of this project as it was a tedious process of understanding the connectivity between rendering the calender and fixing the JS once it breaks every 2 seconds.
It was also a very boring process and wasn't as exciting as other projects.
I am most likely only going to use these skills to build node.js-powered websites to host and run to connect to hardware for future robotics design. Can't say too much though.
